# Rust Version

This version is written against the [Rust modding code](https://github.com/awstanley/hitman.rs) library.  It is also from 2016, but has been refactored and re-tuned in 2019 to resolve a few outstanding issues (as well as to make a few issues public).

It has slightly different arguments, so batch files are supplied to make that easier.

pdb is included so if/when it crashes you can find out why.

## Licence

# Go Version

**You should be using [`h6xtea`](../h6xtea) as it has a multitude of bug fixes.**

This version is written against the Go library and is only partially compliant.

Strictly speaking this binary is AGPLv3.

Sources are in [`h6xxtea`](./h6xxtea) and are restricted to the bundled code.

## Notes

Notes from the author:

  1. It was not my intention for this to go public in this way;
  2. AGPLv3 violation is cleared up (sources used are in the repository now);
  3. This is modified XTEA;
  4. [`h6xtea`](../h6xtea) is what you should be using, this version was abandoned back in 2016 when I rewrote my Go code in Rust (prior to the Bangkok release).

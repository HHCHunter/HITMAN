# HITMAN Tools

Is a collection of tools useful for the HITMANâ„¢ / Glacier 2 engine games.
The pupose of this archive is to keep these tools open source and up-to date as the Glacier 2 engine is continually developped.

## Fileformats
This is useful for beginners to understand what is inside folders once they have been extracted by QuickBMS.

## Networking
Various scripts relating to dealing with HITMAN's networking, some are sourced from [Swixel](https://github.com/swixel).
These are un-maintained and the server version mentioned in the script may change.

Disclaimer: Not to be used for piracy or un-authorized access to servers.

## QuickBMS
Scripts and Hashlist to be used with QuickBMS. This is used to extract the game archives.

## G2TexConv
Work in Progress tool used to convert Glacier 2 Engine textures to Direct Draw Surfaces.

Original source from Xentax User [cippyboy](https://github.com/cippyboy)

Work to be completed includes:

	- Needs refractoring to remove dependacy on cippboy's RE* files.
	- Needs to be improved to support HITMAN 2 textures header.

## h6xxtea
The thumbs.dat file is HITMAN's engine configuration file. 
h6xxtea is used to decrypt the thumbs.dat file for editing and re-encrypt for later engine use.

For unknown reasons IO Interactive decided to encrypt this file with xxtea encyption. I'm unsure why this was done as the file is useful for people who want to make extended configuration changes beyond that of the limited in-game menu settings.

## Licensing & Use

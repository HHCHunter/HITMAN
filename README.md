# HITMAN Tools

## Fileformats
This is useful for beginners to understand what is inside folders once they have been extracted by QuickBMS.

## Networking
Various scripts relating to dealing with HITMAN's networking, some are sourced from [Swixel](https://github.com/swixel).
These are un-maintained and the server version mentioned in the script may change.

Disclaimer: Not to be used for piracy or un-authorized access to servers.

## QuickBMS
Scripts and Hashlist to be used with QuickBMS. This is used to extract the game archives.

## G2TexConv
Work in Progress tool used to convert Glacier 2 Engine textures to Direct Draw Surfaces.

Original source from Xentax User [cippyboy](https://github.com/cippyboy)

Needs refractoring to remove dependacy on cippboy's RE* files.
Need to implement std:string.

## h6xxtea
The thumbs.dat file is HITMAN's engine configuration file. 
h6xxtea is used to decrypt the thumbs.dat file for editing and re-encrypt for later engine use.

For unknown reasons IOI decided to encrypt this file with xxtea encyption. Not sure why this was done as the file is useful for people who want to make extended configuration changes beyond that of the limited in-game menu settings.

Used to decipher and encipher `thumbs.dat` and `packagedefinitions.txt`.

 * `h6xtea` is the Rust (2016) version updated to comply with the format properly:
   * [Online version](https://g2-mods.com/tools/online/xtea/) ([sources]((https://github.com/awstanley/hitman.rs)));
   * Binary version (`h6xtea`) replaces the original ([sources]((https://github.com/awstanley/hitman.rs)));
 * Original (original source [Swixel](https://github.com/awstanley)) retained as `h6xxtea-old.exe`.

This is used to decrypt thumbs.dat for editing and re-encrypt it for the engine to use after editing. The thumbs.dat file is HITMAN's engine configuration file. For unknown reasons IOI decided to encypt this file, which is a useful file for people who want to make extended configuration changes beyond that of ingame settings.
